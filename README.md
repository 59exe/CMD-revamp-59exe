# CMD-revamp-59exe
Hi! I (59exe) have made a custom command prompt, based on the one of Windows NT systems. This works on Windows XP and up.
This works only on Windows, since it is made entirely in Batch and VBScript, so don't be surprised if you get an error when running on macOS/Linux.

When you've downloaded all the flies, place them in the one directory, not that one's in C:\Windows\system32 and another is in C:\user\Documents\githubfolder.
Don't place them in a system directory. A good directory would be somewhere in C:\usernamehere\Documents\
When finished with that, read through info.txt, or just run customcmd.bat. Running anything else won't give you the desired results.
