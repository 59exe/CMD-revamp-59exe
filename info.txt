To launch the command prompt, double-click customcmd.bat - it will then run for you.
Don't x out of the prompt - simply just type 'exit', only use the x button if it has crashed.
Don't modify any of the code, it has already been written for you.
You can look through the code, but do not copy it please, use your own.
You can write your own cmd, with inspiration from mine.
THIS IS NOT A VIRUS. I TAKE NO PLEASURE IN DESTROYING PEOPLE'S PCs, SO I WILL NOT DO IT.
I TEST THIS CODE ON REAL HARDWARE.
